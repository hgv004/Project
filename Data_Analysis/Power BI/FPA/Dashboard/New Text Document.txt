📊🚀 Excited to share my work on the FP20 Analytics Challenge 8! 🚀📊

I participated in the challenge and successfully analyzed the IT HelpDesk Tickets using Power Query and Power BI. 🎯 Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:

📈 Data Preprocessing:
- Extracted First Name and Last Name from Email to enhance the Agent Table.
- Prepared Date of Birth from multiple columns in the Agent Table and calculated Agent Age at 31st Dec, 2020.
- Split the Severity and Priority columns into separate columns "Id" and "Type" for the Tickets Table.

📊 Data Modeling:
- Created separate tables for Severity, Priority, Request, Issue Category, and Date to enhance data analysis.
- Connected dimension tables with the Fact table of Tickets to build a solid foundation.

🔍 Data Analysis:
- Designed an interactive Dashboard with 2 Pages:
   1. IT HelpDesk Tickets Dashboard:
      - Added 3 KPI Metrics: Total Tickets, Avg Resolution Time, and Customer Satisfaction %.
      - Analyzed Urgent and Prioritized Tickets Resolved and Same day Tickets Resolved.
      - Categorized Tickets based on SLA status.
      - Presented the trend of Tickets and 
	  - Visualized Tickets | Avg Resolution Time by Issue type and Category.
      - Visualized a table with Heatmap showcasing Tickets by Severity and Priority.

   2. IT HelpDesk Agent Dashboard:
      - Introduced 5 KPI Metrics: 
		1. Highest Rated Agent 
		2. Lowest Rated Agent
		3. Fastest Agent ( Lowest Avg Resolution Time )
		4. Slowest Agent ( Highest Avg Resolution Time )
		5. Avg Rating
      - Explored Tickets by Age group and Rating frequency.
      - Displayed a table featuring Agent Details and their performance.

🔧 Tools Used:
- Power Query for Data Modeling and Data Preprocessing.
- Power BI for Data Visualization and DAX for advanced analysis.

Special thanks to @Federico Pastor for organizing the challenge and providing the dataset. 🙌
